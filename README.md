### Who Am I?
👋 Hi, I’m @linuxman1000.  I call myself a Linux man because Linux & Open-Source software (OSS) are my passion.  I was introduced to Linux back in 1998 by a friend and I took to it like a duck to water.  Little did I know, I "boarded a train".  It was obvious to me that Linux had far greater capability than the 'cookie cutter' experience of the only other O/S available.  In 1998, Linux was immature (no USB, no overall support, primitive, cumbersome) and its path forward remained to be seen.  My earliest days with Linux were full of bitter frustration, fierce drive and tough resolve.  The experience of Linux has come long, long way which is why in retrospect, I made a good choice.

The social media (SM) revolution took place because of OSS; every SM platform owes its existence to OSS in one way or another (PHP drove a college student from his dorm room to fame & the front entrance of the billionaire's club).  The IT world was dominated by one vendor with a habit of strongarming its way to exclusivity but, after the train cleared the station, that vendor's CEO responded to the train by throwing chairs in his office.  That's how the passengers on that train knew it was picking up speed and getting more powerful.  It was getting near time to adapt or get off the track because a new train was coming, bringing with it a new philosophy of freedom and flexibility, something that the world needed and was yet to really discover.

Fortunately, the chair thrower stepped down and the vendor began adapting which goes to show the power of what became the open source movement.  The train has more locomotives and has really picked up speed. Now, one can hardly keep up with it.  New tracks have been laid to new destinations.  The very creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds is also the creator of a very exciting technology that the site you're reading this on owes its very existence to, Git.  He is one of the MANY people to whom we owe a debt of gratitude for the entire ecosystem that OSS is today.  Git is on the list below and has been, like many OSS developments, the solution to a problem.

Linux is a manifestation of greatness; another came from the decision of a guy in the Netherlands to "work on something" because his office was closed for the holidays.  I am referring to none other than Python, a scripting language that has become one of the most popular scripting and programming languages for its ease of use, ease of learning and simplicity, not to mention, its flexibility and extensibility.

Problems truly are opportunities.  Where we go from here remains to be seen.  One thing is certain, it was my opportunity to board a train that would take me to where I want to go.  I haven't reached my stop yet and I'm not getting off this train anytime soon.  May your curiosity lead to your wisdom and may your wisdom take you where you want to go.  Be wise, my friends.
